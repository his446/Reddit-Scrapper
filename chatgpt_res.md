## Other free news data sources to feed into your ETL pipeline

If you want to supplement or compare Reddit data, consider these sources:

### 1. **News API services (free tier available)**

* [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/) — Aggregates news articles from thousands of sources worldwide.
* [GNews API](https://gnews.io/) — Google News aggregation with free tier.

### 2. **Open Data Platforms**

* [GDELT Project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) — Massive open dataset of global news coverage in multiple languages.
* [EventRegistry](https://eventregistry.org/) — News aggregation with APIs for event and article extraction.

### 3. **RSS Feeds**

* Many news outlets provide RSS feeds you can scrape periodically.
* Example: [Reuters RSS feeds](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/reuters-product/rich-media/rss-feeds/)

### 4. **Twitter (via API)**

* Real-time news and user reactions, though more complex due to rate limits and API rules.

## How to feed these into an ETL pipeline

1. **Extract:**

   * Use `praw` to pull posts from news subreddits.
   * Use API calls to NewsAPI or download datasets from GDELT.
   * Scrape or subscribe to RSS feeds.

2. **Transform:**

   * Clean and parse JSON or HTML data.
   * Normalize timestamps, user info, and text fields.
   * Extract metadata (e.g., sentiment, keywords, location if available).

3. **Load:**

   * Load into a database like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or a data warehouse like BigQuery.
   * Or store raw data files in cloud storage (S3, GCS) for batch processing.

```plaintext
[Reddit API] -> Extract posts/comments from r/news, r/worldnews, etc.
       |
       v
[Transform] -> Clean text, remove duplicates, parse dates, add sentiment scores
       |
       v
[Load] -> Store in database or data lake for analysis
```

If you want, I can help you draft a sample ETL pipeline using Python tools like `praw`, `pandas`, and `Airflow` or `Prefect` for orchestration. Would you like that?
